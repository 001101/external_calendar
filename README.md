## Description
Calendar extension for integration of external calendars with [iCalendar-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar).

This module has **only been tested** in **Humhub v1.2.3 and v1.2.4** with the **calendar module version 0.6.3**!

**Be careful!**
some calendars are not intended for permanent synchronization. These do not send a "last_modified" timestamp. Please do not select the option `auto sync hourly` for these. It could slow down your system..

> For installation instructions take a look at the docs-folder.

## Informations
This module is in Beta and not tested with other external calendars than google (private) and mep24!
Please help to find a solution for the ["upcoming-events"-issue](https://github.com/staxDB/external_calendar/issues/1).
